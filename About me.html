        and a degree in Information Technology.I also have international certificates<br>
        such as CompTia A+ and N+.I've been in different kind of fields when it comes to tech world,<br>
         reason being I am a woman who loves to explore technology in all aspect.<br><br>
        As we all know, technology keeps on changing every now and
        then so basically we learn new things everyday.<br>
        I am currently in technical and networking world but coding also stole
        my heart.<br>
         I love to learn new things everyday and I believe that I am a fast learner,<br> 
         persistent, consistent and dedicated to what I set my heart to. During<br>
         my studies I learned the importance of being disciplined, completing my work<br>
         on time and to a high standard, and supporting other students on their work.</p>
